The project was updated to include a functional "head-to-head" multiplayer feature. This involved adding a turn-based system that tracks the current player and their scores. The game now displays which player's turn it is and increments their score when they find a match. Additionally, the turn switches only when a player fails to find a match. These changes were implemented by modifying the JavaScript logic to handle player turns and scores, updating the HTML to display player information, and ensuring the CSS styles aligned with the new functionality.
