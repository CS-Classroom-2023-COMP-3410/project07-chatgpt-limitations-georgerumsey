There were two main features I was able to fix about the design in this project. First, I waas able to make sure that the game container was dynamically sized so that the fruit border was always visible around it. THis task was not to difficult but the other fix of making sure that the whole game board was always visible without scrolling was a much greater challenge. I orginally tried to have a dynamic grid for the tiles so that the gameboard space could be best used while also trying to maintian the 1:1 aspect ratio of the tiles. I spent I very long time working this way without much progress. In the end, I decided to always keep the 4x4 grid and just size each tile in regards to its parent element without a min height or width. The one minor drawback to this approach is that in extremely wide and short window the tiles get streched out, but it is still fully playable even in this window size that is very unlikely to be used.
